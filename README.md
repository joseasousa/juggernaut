## Patterns

These are some of patterns definitions to help us to keep a default configuration and front-end arquitecture.

- NPM or Yarn? Your call.
- UI Kit library? Jump into [MaterialUI](https://material-ui.com)
- Linter: If You don't use [Gandalf Lint](https://github.com/SoftboxLab/gandalf-lint), you shall not pass.
- Do you want a component pattern? [Get here](src/containers/Home/index.jsx)

### Project structure

- **src/assets**: Static files (images, fonts and icons);
- **src/components**: Components of React to be shared and reused in the project;
- **src/commons**: Utilities, resources, constants, assets, configurations, i18n and others;
- **src/containers**: Page components that apply business knowledge and present themselves as pages;
- **src/routes**: Routes of app to be used by SPA and user navigation;
- **src/store**: State configuration with Redux;
